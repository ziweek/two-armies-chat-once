In South Korea, there is a unique military program known as KATUSA (Korean Augmentation to the U.S. Army). Although KATUSA soldiers are South Korean citizens, they are assigned to U.S. Army units and operate under U.S. Army command. Due to this unique structure, KATUSA soldiers are required to follow both U.S. Army regulations and ROK Army (Republic of Korea Army) regulations. However, these two sets of regulations are sometimes incompatible, leading to confusion about the cultural and procedural differences between the two military systems.
